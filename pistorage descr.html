pi can be considered as an ultimate storage - every sequence of numbers that is in the universe can be found in pi
to express any sequence of numbers, we need to know the starting point and the length of the sequence
all the recipient needs to know is the starting point and the length of the sequence
all that is needed is to chunk the payload into maneageable pieces, longer than the sequence needed to express the starting point and the length of the sequence
any number system can be used to express the pi or e or any constant with infinite semi-randomly evolving sequence of numbers - that gives us much more flexibility 
there will be four values used to express the starting point and the length of the sequence
the numeric system base may go up to unicode, where 1 is the first character of unicode table
1. the numeric system base - use the base that is most suitable for the message
2. the constant used
3. the starting point expressed in the numeric system base
4. the length of the sequence expressed in the numeric system base

create mathematical functions that will be able to most efficiently count the lowest starting point and the length of the sequence in any numeric system base
create a method that will return the four values needed to express the given payload
create a method that will take a message and the four values and return the payload message
create a simple user interface that will allow the user to input the message and get the four values needed to express the message
create a simple user interface that will allow the user to input the four values and get the message
